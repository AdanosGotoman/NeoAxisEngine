Shortly about the license. You can use NeoAxis Engine for free without any future royalties and distribute source codes subject to the following conditions:
<ul>
<li>1. When publishing your product, you must add "Made with NeoAxis Engine (www.neoaxis.com)" with the product information and in its credits.
</li>

<li>2. You can distribute the NeoAxis editor with your product. When you distribute the NeoAxis editor, or any another application which uses editor's code, the window title of the application should contains a text in the form:
  
  "Your project name - NeoAxis Engine 2020.3 (www.neoaxis.com)".
  
  Or if you made engine modification:
  
  "Your project name - Modified version of NeoAxis Engine 2020.3 (www.neoaxis.com)"

This can be done by changing the value of the ModifiedVersionOfNeoAxisEngine field in the Sources\Engine\NeoAxis.Core\Utility\EngineInfo.cs file.</li>

<li>3. You can distribute the source code of the NeoAxis Engine. In the case of publishing any part of the modified Source Code, for example, by means of creating a fork or other distribution method, you automatically become the contributor of the NeoAxis Engine. This means that the NeoAxis Group Ltd reserves the right to use your modified source code at its discretion, for example, to improve the original version of the NeoAxis Engine. Copyright for modified code is saved to you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<b>Did I understand correctly that the NeoAxis Engine is provided free of charge with full source code, while the royalties are completely absent? I should not even add splash screen when starting my game, just mention it in the credits?</b>
That's right. However, we will be glad of any help in the development of the engine, including its popularization.
